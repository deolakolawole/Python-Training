# # for Loop Exercise

# Question 1.
# Given a list of numbers, find the average using for loop
# 
# Number = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

# ***Hint***
# Start with sum = 0

# In[ ]:


sum = 0
## Type your answer here.
number = [10,20,30,40,50,60]
sum = 0
for i in number:
    sum = sum + i
print sum




# Expected Output
# 
# 35

# 
# 
# 
# 
# Question 2. 
# Write a program that prompts a user to enter 2 integers.
# suppose the integers are p and q, the program then prints p rows of q hastags.
# 
# for instance, the program may behave as shown in the expected output
# 

# ***Hint***
# you will need 2 for loops together
# 
# ***Note*** by default print() function adds a new line at the end of its output.
# if you do not want this to happen, you have to pass in end = '' to the print() function.
# This will remove the new line. ***Note*** the '' is made of 2 single quotes not single double quote
# 
# For instance
# 
# print ('A')
# 
# Print ('B')
# 
# gives us
# 
# A
# 
# B
# 
# while 
# 
# print ('A', end = '')
# 
# Print ('B', end = '')
# 
# gives us
# 
# AB
# 

# In[ ]:





# Expected output
# 
# Lets say user entered p == 5 and q == 10
# 
# ##########
# 
# ##########
# 
# ##########
# 
# ##########
# 
# ##########

# In[ ]:


p = int(input('Please enter the number of rows: '))
q = int(input('Please enter the number of Hastags per row: '))
##Type your answer here.
p = int(int("Please enter the number of rows:"))
q = int(input("Please enter the number of Hashtags per row:"))
for i in range (p):
  print ""
  for j in range (q)
  print "#",





# Question 3
# Write a for loop which print "Hello!, " plus each name in the list. i.e.: "Hello!, Ade"

# In[ ]:


lst=["Ade", "Ada", "Chidi", "Ola", "Nkechi", "Emma", "Abdul"]
###Type your answer here.
list = ["Ade", "Ada", "Chidi", "Ola", "Nkechi", "Emma", "Abdul"]
for i in list:
  print "Hello!,",i


# Using a for loop and .append() method append each item with a Dr. prefix to the lst.

# **HINT 1**
# “Dr. ” + i will create a string with “Dr. ” prefix and name.
# 
# **HINT 2**
# .append() method can be u

# In[ ]:


lst1=["Phil", "Oz", "Seuss", "Dre"]
lst2=[]
#Type your answer here.




print(lst2)
