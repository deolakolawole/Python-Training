# # Exercise 1: Create a list by picking an odd-index items from the first list and even index items from the second.
# 
# Given two lists, l1 and l2, write a program to create a third list l3 by picking an odd-index elements from the list l1 and even index elements from the list l2.
# 
# l1 = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
# 
# l2 = [4, 8, 13, 16, 20, 24, 28]

# # ****HINT***
# use slicing
# 
# # Expected Output
# 
# Element at odd-index positions from list one
# 
# [6, 12, 18]
# 
# Element at even-index positions from list two
# 
# [4, 12, 20, 28]
# 
# Printing Final third list
# 
# [6, 12, 18, 4, 12, 20, 28]

l1 = [2,3,4]
print(l1)
# # Exercise 2: Remove and add item in a list
# 
# Write a program to remove the item present at index 4 and add it to the 2nd position and at the end of the list.
# 
# list1[34, 54, 67, 89, 11, 43, 94]

# # ***HINT***
# Use the list methods, pop(), insert() and append()
# 
# 
# # Expected Output:
# 
# 
# List After removing element at index 4  [34, 54, 67, 89, 43, 94]
# 
# List after Adding element at index 2  [34, 54, 11, 67, 89, 43, 94]
# 
# List after Adding element at last  [34, 54, 11, 67, 89, 43, 94, 11]

# # Exercise 3
# 
# Write a program to finad all occurrences of "NIGERIA" in a given string ignoring the cases.
# 
# str1 ="NIGERIA is great. only that  politicians in nigeria have killed nigeria"

# # ****HINT****
# use sub str.
# use the string function count( )
# 
# # expected output
# The NIGERIA count is: 3
